# ToyLisp

A toy Lisp interpreter in Swift I tried to write after seeing Peter Norvig's version in Python.

It's still a work in progress and there's lots of things which could be improved.

The Xcode project starts the repl and you can play with it in the playground as well. Just uncomment the last line to watch it run. Had to do that as both run off of the same file.
